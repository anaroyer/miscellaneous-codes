# Hello, and welcome to my miscellanea repository!
### This repository contains various types of code, including exercises from Exercism.org, challenges from different courses I enrolled in and small personal projects. For now, this repository is 100% Python. In this README file, you can find a link for all the codes in this repository and a small explanation of their purposes.

### **[Simple calculator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/calculadora1.py)**
Not much to explain here. This code asks you for two different numbers and an operation, and outputs the result of the operation accordingly. 

### **[CPF generator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/gerador_de_cpf.py)**
In Brazil, every person has their very own CPF, a unique eleven-digit number used to identify individuals. It is very important since it's used for everything regarding the government and the law, including voting, opening bank accounts, and other legal matters. The CPF is composed of three sets of three regular digits, and one set of two check-digits. Its format is XXX.XXX.XXX-XX.  
This code uses the official CPF algorithm, used by the brazilian goverment, to generate a random number that would serve as a valid CPF. 

### **[CPF validator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/validador_de_cpf.py)**
In Brazil, every person has their very own CPF, a unique eleven-digit number used to identify individuals. It is very important since it's used for everything regarding the government and the law, including voting, opening bank accounts, and other legal matters. The CPF is composed of three sets of three regular digits, and one set of two check-digits. Its format is XXX.XXX.XXX-XX.  
This code uses the official CPF algorithm, used by the brazilian goverment, to verify if a given eleven-digit number is a valid CPF.

### **[ISBN validator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/isbn.py)**

### **[Cipher translator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/cipher.py)**
