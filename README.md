# Hello, and welcome to my miscellanea repository!
### This repository contains various types of code, including exercises from Exercism.org, challenges from different courses I enrolled in and small personal projects. For now, this repository is 100% Python. In this README file, you can find a link for all the codes in this repository and a small explanation of their purposes.

### **[Simple calculator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/calculadora1.py)**
Not much to explain here. This code asks you for two different numbers and an operation, and outputs the result of the operation accordingly. 

### **[CPF generator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/gerador_de_cpf.py)**
In Brazil, every person has their very own CPF, a unique eleven-digit number used to identify individuals. It is very important since it's used for everything regarding the government and the law, including voting, opening bank accounts, and other legal matters. The CPF is composed of three sets of three regular digits, and one set of two check-digits. Its format is XXX.XXX.XXX-XX.  
This code uses the official CPF algorithm, used by the brazilian goverment, to generate a random number that would serve as a valid CPF. 

### **[CPF validator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/validador_de_cpf.py)**
In Brazil, every person has their very own CPF, a unique eleven-digit number used to identify individuals. It is very important since it's used for everything regarding the government and the law, including voting, opening bank accounts, and other legal matters. The CPF is composed of three sets of three regular digits, and one set of two check-digits. Its format is XXX.XXX.XXX-XX.  
This code uses the official CPF algorithm, used by the brazilian goverment, to verify if a given eleven-digit number is a valid CPF.

### **[ISBN validator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/isbn.py)**
The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a thirteen-digit number used to identify books. The different numbers identify the title, writer, country and publisher. Once a book is given a number, that number is valid only for that specific version. This code uses the official ISBN algorithm to identify if a given 13-digit number is a valid ISBN number.

### **[Cipher translator](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/cipher.py)**
The rotational cipher or Caesar cipher is a method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. This code converts a given text to the rotational cipher using a given key(number).

### **[Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/anaroyer/miscellaneous-codes/blob/master/collatz.py)**
The Collatz Conjecture, also known as 3x + 1 problem, states that if you take any positive integer n, and if n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2 or if n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1, and repeat the process indefinitely, no matter which n number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually. 
This code takes a positive integer and returns the number of steps it took to get to 1 using the Collatz Conjecture.
